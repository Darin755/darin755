## About Me
 - I am a Softmore at UCCS studying Computer Science. I have experiment with many different services, software and technologies in my free time and I love to work on my homelab.  I have taken several engineering classes in high school which taught me how to design and build engineering projects. I especially like Linux and open source services like Nextcloud. 

## Projects and accomplishments
 - Linux in your browser: [https://github.com/Darin755/browser-linux](https://github.com/Darin755/browser-linux)
 - The services in my homelab. All services are hosted on my Proxmox cluster and network traffic is routed into my homelabs network though a VPS in Linode. (Wireguard and Nginx Proxy) Here's a list of all services I host:
   - Nextcloud
   - gitea
   - FMD (Find my device)
   - Drupal
   - Matrix
   - Jellyfin
   - My virtual PC (Made with vfio!)
   - proxies and other networking related stuff (incoming traffic comes in via Wireguard)
